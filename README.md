# rastafari

Rastafarian Vim dark color scheme with 256 color terminal support.

For better colors, it is recommended to add in your ~/.vimrc:

```vim
set t_Co=256
set termguicolors
```

## Installation

### Via Plugin Manager (recommended)

Take [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for example:

```vim
Plug 'dpelle/rastafari'
```

### Manually

Copy `rastafari.vim` to `~/.vim/colors` (on Windows `<your-vim-dir>\vimfiles\colors`).

Then add the line `colorscheme rastafari` in your _vimrc_ file, and restart Vim.

## Donations

This color scheme is dedicated to the Ugandan children (How about donating to them? See Vim's website).
